It provides a high-level API to discover, create and run generators, as well as further tuning of where and how a generator is resolved.

```
$ npm install yeoman-environment
```


## Usage

Full documentation available [here](http://yeoman.io/authoring/integrating-yeoman.html).

```js
const yeoman = require('yeoman-environment');
const env = yeoman.createEnv();

// The #lookup() method will search the user computer for installed generators
// The search if done from the current working directory
env.lookup(() => {
  env.run('angular', {'skip-install': true}, err => {
    console.log('done');
  });
});
```
